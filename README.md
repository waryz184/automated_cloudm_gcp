# Project Title

Automated CloudM project creation on Google Cloud Platform.

## Description

This script is used to automate the creation of a GCP project to let CloudM access the Google APIs.
I wrote it with user input to customize the project creation based on the name and service account

It's not based on the .ps1 in the Cloud M manual but using gcloud man to just have the minimalist commands.
